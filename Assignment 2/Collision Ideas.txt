- Use the row-major index of the pixels to determine when you hit a wall. When you get to that specific pixel, reverse the horizontal direction
- To bounce off the bricks will have two different cases, one where you bounce from the top and one where you bounce from below
	- If you bounce from below, reverse the vertical direction so that the ball bounces back down to the floor
		- Similarly use this same idea when you hit the ceiling
	- If you bounce from above, reverse the vertical direction such that the ball bounces upwards
	
	
- An easier solution might be that instead of relying on the individual pixels being hit, we can instead hold the ball within a bounded area. For example, the ball can't go past x width and must stay within x width. Same also applies for height where the ball must stay within y height
	- However this can only work for the wall collisions
