- Use the row-major index of the pixels to determine when you hit a wall. When you get to that specific pixel, reverse the horizontal direction
- To bounce off the bricks will have two different cases, one where you bounce from the top and one where you bounce from below
	- If you bounce from below, reverse the vertical direction so that the ball bounces back down to the floor
		- Similarly use this same idea when you hit the ceiling
	- If you bounce from above, reverse the vertical direction such that the ball bounces upwards
